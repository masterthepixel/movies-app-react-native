## Setting Up Environment

1. Follow [this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide for first steps including device/emulator setup
   - Make sure to install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install)
2. In VSCode install the following extensions for our linting rules:
   - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
   - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
   - [React Native Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native) _This is required to debug app and use env files_
3. Clone the repo then run `npm ci` or `yarn install` in your terminal in the root directory of the project
4. In ios folder, run `pod install` or `pod update` in your terminal.
5. If you don’t already have an account on [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started), you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
6. Open duplicate `.env.example` then rename the duplicate to `.env` with adding your TMDB API key as API_KEY like `API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
   Important: Clear build cache whenever you change env file.

## Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
